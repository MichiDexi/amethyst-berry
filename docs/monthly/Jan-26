It's been a full month since I started working on this project
It's almost done, it'll be finished next month
You can expect a perfectly working v1.0 in February
If something does break, there will be a v1.1
Basically, major updates every 2 months and patches when needed

This month has been eventful
TUI library, input library, menus, filesystem... everything came this month
Now I just need to glue all those layers together, to make a working TUI application

Yes, I did want to release v1 today and release versions every month,
but, as you see, I wasn't able to finish this in time
I've worked 23 hours in the past 10 days alone, I wasn't lazy

I promise, it'll be done by next month
